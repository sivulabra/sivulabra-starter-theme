# Sivulabra Starter Theme
A starting point for most Sivulabra WordPress projects.

Sivulabra Starter Theme includes vanilla WordPress functionality with a modern twist. Newer technologies like React are easy to integrate to this theme. Node dependencies are automatically split and loaded by the theme individually. JS and CSS filename hashing is also included. This theme is kept **extra light** to avoid performance issues.

## 🚀 Installation
Under construction.

## 🔧 Development
Developing with this theme is easy.
1. Customize `assets/build/config.js` to your specifications. Minimal setup would require you to just update the `devUrl` value. Otherwise the setup is pretty universal, but you can tweak things if you'd like.
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory of the theme to install dependencies.
3. All done. Now you can use either `npm run start` to develop locally or `npm run build` to build a production version of the theme.

### Commands
- `npm start` Start a local development environment.
- `npm run build` Build a production-ready version of the theme.

## 📂 Structure
Under construction.

## ❔ Motive
This starter theme exists to significantly speed up the development of projects. Using this theme as a starting point, around 80 hours of work can be avoided at the start of each project.
